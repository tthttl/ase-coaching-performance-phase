# Week 3 Journal

## Reflections

- **Day 1:**  
  _I read the concept of the game in advance so today I could start the implementation with an idea in mind._
  _I decided to implement the board as a simple array, where I already replace the numbers on the indices affected by a ladder bottom or a snake head to represent the slides._
  _I was not sure if I should add a Board class or just two Players, so I started to write the test cases, to see which one I actually need._
  _Some of the rules already work, I am confident the approach works and I can reach a near complete solution tomorrow._
