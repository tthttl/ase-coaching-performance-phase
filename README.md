# Coding Performance Phase Guidelines

## Goal
Practice what you have learned so far and focus on writing higher quality code!

## Daily Hour Structure
- **50 Minutes:** Programming Block
- **10 Minutes:** Reflection (write in the weekly journal markdown file)

At the end of the hour:
- Commit your work to your Git repository.
- Delete your coding files.
- Start each day from a clean repository.

## Preparation & Analysis
You may prepare or analyze before/after sessions. This includes:
- Pizza diagrams
- Message and data-flow diagrams
- CRC cards (optional)

## Version Control
Use **GIT** to track your daily implementations.

At the end of **Week 3**, provide your zipped Git folder to the coaches.

## Folder Structure
forename_lastname_YYYYMMDD_Coaching_Level_Program
Week_1
/src
week_1_journal.md
Week_2
/src
week_2_journal.md
Week_3
/src
week_3_journal.md

- The top-level folder includes the start date (`YYYYMMDD`).
- For `Coaching_Level_Program`, choose one: `FL`, `AL1`, `AL2`, or `PL`.
- Place your code in the `/src` folder.
- Write daily reflections in the corresponding `week_..._journal.md` file.
